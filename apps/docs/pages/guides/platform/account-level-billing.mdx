<Admonition type="note">This is for users considering or on Enterprise plan only.</Admonition>

By default, each organization has a subscription and a plan. For our Enterprise customers, we offer Account-level-Billing, so multiple organizations can point to a single Enterprise subscription, further simplifying billing.

![Account-Level-Billing: Overview](/docs/img/guides/platform/account-level-billing.png)

With Account-Level-Billing, all organizations and projects within the subscription are recognized as Enterprise and your support tier or security addons propagate to all projects.

For the usage-billing, weâ€™ll sum up the usage from all organizations and projects. You can still break down the usage per organization or per project by going to the [organization billing page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).

Account-Level-Billing is not self-serve. Please reach out to your customer success contact person to set this up.
