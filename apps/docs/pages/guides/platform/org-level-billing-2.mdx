<Admonition type="note">
Org-Level-Billing was introduced on the August xth 2023. Read the [announcement blog post](https://announce.ment) for more context.
</Admonition>

Supabase has organizations and projects. An organization may contain multiple projects. A project is a dedicated Supabase instance with all of its sub-services including Storage, Auth, Functions and Realtime.

Each organization only has a single subscription with a single plan (Free, Pro, Team or Enterprise). Project addons such as [Compute](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons), [Custom Domains](/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains) and [PITR](/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery) are configured per project and are added to your organization subscription.

**Organization-Level-Billing Overview**

![Billing: After](/docs/img/guides/platform/org-billing-after.png)
## Unified Egress

In an effort to provide a more fair egress quota for all users, we unified egress to be a single usage-based item. You get a total quota, i.e. 250GB on the Pro plan, and can use it for anything, be it Storage, Realtime, Auth, Functions or Database.

While the quota and billing is based on the unified egress, you can still see a breakdown of the different types of egress on your [organization usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage).

![Unified Egress](/docs/img/guides/platform/unified-egress.png)

Quotas for unified egress, applies to your entire organization:

| Plan       | Total Egress Quota |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Free       | 10 GB              |
| Pro        | 250 GB             |
| Team       | 250 GB             |
| Enterprise | Custom             |

## Quota/Features per organization

With Organization-Level-Billing, the quotas and features are for your entire organization. Independent of how many projects you launch, your included quota stays the same. For billing purposes, we sum up the usage from all projects for your monthly invoice.

As the plan is set for your entire organization, upgrading your organization to a paid plan means that you unlock the benefits of the paid plan for **all** projects inside your organizations, i.e. no project in your organization will be paused on a Pro plan.

Quotas for Organization-Level-Billing, these quotas apply to your entire organization:

| Metric                     | Free                     | Pro/Team                                    | Enterprise |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Egress\*                   | 10GB                     | 250GB included, then $0.09 per GB           | Custom     |
| Database Size              | 1GB                      | 8GB included, then $0.125 per GB            | Custom     |
| Storage Size               | 2GB                      | 100GB included, then $0.021 per GB          | Custom     |
| Monthly Active Users       | 50.000 MAU               | 100.000 MAU included, then $0.00325 per MAU | Custom     |
| Function Invocations       | 1.000.000                | 2.000.000 included, then $2 per 1.000.000   | Custom     |
| Function Count             | 20                       | 100 included, then $10 per 100              | Custom     |
| Storage Images Transformed | Unavailable on Free plan | 100 included, then $5 per 1000              | Custom     |
| Realtime Message Count     | 2.000.000                | 5.000.000 included, then $2.5 per 1.000.000 | Custom     |
| Realtime Peak Connections  | 200                      | 500 included, then $10 per 1000             | Custom     |

You can launch as many organizations as you want, so you can still create two organizations on the Pro plan for $25 each and launch a single project in each one. You'd have the same quotas and pricing as of today.

## Usage-based billing for compute

Each Supabase project comes with a dedicated server. By default, your instance runs on the Starter Compute instance. You can upgrade your compute size in your [project settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons).

With Organization-Level-Billing you won't get an immediate charge upfront when changing compute, instead we'll bill you based on compute runtime hours when your billing cycle resets.

If you launch a second or third instance on your paid plan, it just adds additional compute hours that we'll bill you on.

<Admonition type="note">
We only count compute hours for instances that are active. Paused projects do not count towards compute usage and you can pause/unpause projects at any time.
</Admonition>

Pricing for Compute Hours:

| Instance Size | Hourly Price | Estimated Monthly Price |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Starter       | $0.01344     | ~$10                    |
| Small         | $0.0206      | ~$15                    |
| Medium        | $0.0822      | ~$60                    |
| Large         | $0.1517      | ~$110                   |
| XL            | $0.2877      | ~$210                   |
| 2XL           | $0.562       | ~$410                   |
| 4XL           | $1.32        | ~$960                   |
| 8XL           | $2.562       | ~$1870                  |
| 12XL          | $3.836       | ~$2800                  |
| 16XL          | $5.12        | ~$3730                  |


### Compute Credits

Paid plans come with $10 of Compute Credits to cover one Starter instance or parts of any other [Compute add-on](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons).

Compute Credits are deducted from your Compute Usage. You can launch as many instances as you want on paid plans and we'll bill based on the compute hours. If you upgrade an instance for 24 hours, you'll only be billed for those 24 hours of additional compute. Compute hours are billed when you do plan up/downgrades (resets the billing cycle) or whenever your billing cycle resets once a month.

Compute Credits do not apply to other usage fees like egress, database size, ... They solely apply to Compute usage. You will be charged for compute hours independent of your [Spend Cap](/docs/guides/platform/spend-cap).

Additionally, Compute Credits reset every month and do not accumulate, in case you're not running any projects.

## Legacy Billing

In organizations created before August xth 2023, each project had an individual subscription, a plan and addons.

**Legacy Billing before August xth 2023**

![Billing Before](/docs/img/guides/platform/org-billing-before.png)

We moved subscriptions and the subscription plan to the organization level. By moving the subscription to the organization level, each organization only has a single subscription with a single plan

With this change in billing, we also lay the groundwork for upcoming features like [environment branching](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-local-dev#branching-and-preview-environments), usage notifications, more sophisticated cost control and much more. Most noticable changes:

**Unified egress**

We no longer separate storage and database egress, see [above](/docs/guides/platform/org-level-billing#unified-egress) for unified egress quota.

**Quota/Features per project**

Previously, each project had an individual plan and the included quotas and features were on a project level. With Organization-Level-Billing, the quotas and features are for your entire organization.

Besides the unified egress, the quota for the Pro and Team plan have not changed. We are also not changing any fees for over-usage.

**Compute Usage Billing**

Previously, when you wanted to upgrade the Compute Add-On, you immediately prepay the prorated amount (days left in your current billing cycle) and you always paid upfront for the entire month when your billing cycle resets. When you downgrade, you got the appropriate credits for unused time. Full-month upfront payments are annoying, especially when you just want to do a temporary upgrade. We've heard your feedback and are moving billing for compute to hourly usage.

<Admonition type="note">
You can still have two projects for free, either in a single free plan org or in two free plan orgs with one project each.

On paid plans, the first project comes with no additional costs. If you have an organisation on the Pro plan and you launch your first project, you're paying $25/month, just like before.

</Admonition>

With Organization-Level-Billing, you are no longer paying $25 for every additonal Pro plan project in your organisation, but rather just for the additional compute. Previously, we gave you a free “Starter” instance on paid plans - we're now giving you $10 in Compute Credits instead, to cover the first instance. You end up not paying extra for the first project inside your paid plan organisation - just like before. In case you add a Compute Add-On to your first project, you also end up paying exactly the same as before.

### Examples

If you just have a single project in your organization, you won't really be affected. Here are some examples on how the new organization-level billing looks like compared to the previous project-level billing.

#### Multiple free plan projects

Let's say you currently have two free plan projects in your organization. As we're not changing the amount of free projects you can have, you can simply migrate that organization to a free plan. The most important change is the quota being for your entire organization now. Rather than each project having it's individual quota, your organization will now have the following limits:

| Usage Item                 | Quota                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Egress                     | 10GB                     |
| Database Size              | 1GB                      |
| Storage Size               | 2GB                      |
| Monthly Active Users       | 50.000 MAU               |
| Function Invocations       | 1.000.000                |
| Function Count             | 20                       |
| Storage Images Transformed | Unavailable on Free plan |
| Realtime Message Count     | 2.000.000                |
| Realtime Peak Connections  | 200                      |

If you're only using a single project, you could then use 1GB of database size. If you launch a second instance, the sum of both projects can't exceed 1GB.

#### Multiple pro plan projects

If you're currently running multiple Pro plan projects, each one costs you $25 for the Pro plan + usage + addons. With Organization-Level-Billing, you only pay for the Pro plan once, but you also only get the included quota once.

**Invoice Breakdown before August xth 2023**

| Line Item              | Price |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Pro Plan for Project 1 | $25   |
| Pro Plan for Project 2 | $25   |
| Pro Plan for Project 3 | $25   |
| Total                  | $75   |

**Current Invoice Breakdown**

| Line Item                 | Price |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| Pro Plan for Organization | $25   |
| Starter Compute x3        | $30   |
| Compute Credits           | $-10  |
| Total                     | $45   |

<Admonition type="note">
  Paused projects do not count towards compute usage. If you pause one of your Pro projects manually, you will not be charged for compute hours.
</Admonition>

You're paying less for multiple projects on the Pro plan. However, you're no longer getting the quota thrice, but only once. Here's the quota for your entire organization:

| Usage Item                 | Quota                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Egress\*                   | 250GB included, then $0.09 per GB           |
| Database Size              | 8GB included, then $0.125 per GB            |
| Storage Size               | 100GB included, then $0.021 per GB          |
| Monthly Active Users       | 100.000 MAU included, then $0.00325 per MAU |
| Function Invocations       | 2.000.000 included, then $2 per 1.000.000   |
| Function Count             | 100 included, then $10 per 100              |
| Storage Images Transformed | 100 included, then $5 per 1000              |
| Realtime Message Count     | 5.000.000 included, then $2.5 per 1.000.000 |
| Realtime Peak Connections  | 500 included, then $10 per 1000             |

If you wish to keep the same quota for each project, you'd have to separate your projects into three organizations on the Pro plan. You'd end up paying the same ($75) and getting the same quota as before.

See [Project Transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer) to move projects across organizations.

#### Mix of free and pro plan projects

If you're currently running a mix of Free and Pro plan projects and migrate that to a Pro plan organization, your base fee might be higher, but you'll also get the [benefits](https://supabase.com/pricing) of the paid plan for **all** projects including no auto-pausing, daily backups, storage image transformations, 7-day log retention.

**Invoice Breakdown before August xth 2023**

| Line Item               | Price |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Pro Plan for Project 1  | $25   |
| Pro Plan for Project 2  | $25   |
| Free Plan for Project 3 | $0    |
| Free Plan for Project 4 | $0    |
| Total                   | $50   |

**Current Invoice Breakdown**

| Line Item                 | Price |
| ------------------------- | ----- |
| Pro Plan for Organization | $25   |
| Starter Compute x4        | $40   |
| Compute Credits           | $-10  |
| Total                     | $55   |

All [benefits](https://supabase.com/pricing) of the Pro plan apply to all projects within your organization.

<Admonition type="note">
  You can transfer projects to a free organization, in case you haven't used up your 2 free project limit, if you don't want additional projects on the Pro plan. See [Project Transfers](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer).
</Admonition>
### Self-Serve-Migration

While we will roll out the new billing for all users during the next few weeks, you can pro-actively migrate, too. If you're not using Organization-Level-Billing yet, you may initiate the migration to Organization-Level-Billing yourself. We'll also actively reach out to you, in case you have multiple paid projects or a mix of paid and non-paid projects.

Head over to your [organization billing settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing) to initiate the migration.

### FAQ

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>What happens to the 2 free plan projects?</i>
  </summary>

We are not changing your 2 free project limit. You can either have two organizations on a free plan with one project each, or one organization on a free plan with two projects inside.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>What happens to the spend cap?</i>
  </summary>
  The spend cap still exists, it's just set on the organization-level and not per project. Head over
  to your [organization billing settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing) to toggle your
  spend cap. We're working on more fine-grained control over costs to supersede the spend cap.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <i>How do I know if I'm using the new organization-level billing?</i>
  </summary>
 If you head over to your [organizations' billing settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing) and it displays your organization plan at the top, it means you already use the new organization-level billing. If it shows you the section to migrate the project to the new billing, you're using the old project-level billing.
